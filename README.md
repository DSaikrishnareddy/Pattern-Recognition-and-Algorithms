Simulation of a Binary Class Problem in MatLab

## Computation of Decision Boundary, Data Generator, Classifier and the Count of errors

In a Binary Class problem with class c1 and c2 and Probability Distribution Function of feature Vector x is multivariate Gaussian for bot the classes.We can assume P(c1) and P(c2) as the prior probabilities.

### The 4 blocks required to solve this problem.
1. Decision Boundary
2. Data Generator
3. Classifier
4. Count of Errors

#### Decision Boundary
